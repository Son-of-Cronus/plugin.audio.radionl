## Introduction
RadioNL is a Kodi audio add-on which allows you to listen and sometimes watch streams of Dutch Radio stations.
## Installing RadioNL
Starting from Kodi Leia (v18), you can easily install RadioNL Service from the official <a href="https://github.com/Son-of-Cronus/underworld/tree/master/repository.underworld/" rel="nofollow">Underworld</a> add-on repository. Simply use the search function in the add-ons section to find RadioNL and install it.

<strong>Note:</strong> Make sure the Auto-Update option for RadioNL is enabled to automagically receive new updates.

### Kodi Leia and Matrix
We support the previous and the current release of Kodi. So with the release of Kodi Matrix (v19), the support for Kodi Leia (v18) is continued and Krypton(v17) has been removed.
